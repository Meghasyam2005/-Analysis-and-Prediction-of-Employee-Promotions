# -Analysis-and-Prediction-of-Employee-Promotions
This project applies various machine learning classification algorithms to predict employee promotion eligibility. It addresses the limitations of traditional, subjective promotion processes by leveraging a dataset from Kaggle to build and evaluate predictive models.
This project aims to predict whether an employee is qualified for promotion using various machine learning classification algorithms. It addresses the common challenge in organizations where promotion decisions are often based on subjective supervisor judgments. By leveraging a comprehensive dataset and multiple predictive models, this project provides a data-driven approach to identifying high-potential employees.
ðŸš€ Project Overview
The project uses a dataset from Kaggle 2020, which contains employee information from a multinational company. The dataset includes 54,808 rows and 13 columns, covering various employee attributes across nine broad verticals. We developed and evaluated several predictive models to forecast employee promotion eligibility.
Key Objectives:
Develop Predictive Models: Utilize classification algorithms to build models that can accurately predict employee promotion.
Identify Key Attributes: Determine the most significant factors influencing an employee's promotion potential.
Benchmark Algorithms: Compare the performance of different models to identify the most effective one.
